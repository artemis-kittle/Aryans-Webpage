        <ul>
            <li>
                This website has been made in accordance with all the rules and suggestions outlined 
                on Canvas for this assignment. There are four html documents, <ins>index.html</ins>, <ins>past.html</ins>, <ins>future.html</ins> and <ins>comments.html</ins> 
                with one Cascading Style Sheet, <ins>websystems.css</ins> and various jpg, png and jpeg pictures. As requested by the subject coordinator and tutor, <ins>no Javascript, PHP, or 
                templates have been used</ins>. All the content, including the pictures and texts, are original and made by me.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The general structure of the four webpages is below: 
                <br>
                <img src="images/structure.png" alt="Structure Image" class="center">
            </li>
            <br>
             <li>
                Title:
                <br>
            All the webpages have "Title" added in the <'head'> section so that the title of the webpage appears on the tab of browsers. 
        </li>
        <br>
            <li> 
                Navigation Bar:
                <br>
        
            
            A consistent navigation menu bar at the top of the webpage is used for cycling through the pages. 
            When mouse is hovered over the buttons of navigation 
            bar, text colour and background changes to show which button is being selected. 
            
            
              
    
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Image:
            <br>
            All the webpages have thematic image with the title of the webpage.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Text Boxes:
            <br>
            All the text are in text boxes. Rectangular Text boxes were looking too generic. Inspired from Apple's website, all text boxes were made 
            round-cornered by using "border radius" property of CSS. The round-cornered borders are in 
              accordance with the theme of each page.
        </li>
        <br>
        
       
        
        <li>
            Footers: 
            <br>
            Basic information, as well as bookmarks [directional buttons] are placed at the bottom of each page and are in accordance with the theme of the webpage. 
        </li>
        <br>
        
       <li>
        What I tried to add but failed: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                I tried to add a Favicon [a website icon associated with a particular website, 
                typically displayed in the address bar of a browser accessing the site]. I debugged and tried 
                a lot but it looked as if the favicon of Ed always overrided my icon. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I tried to add a gif in the homepage, it worked and looked good, but then my website
                    was taking a lot of space and the marker on Ed said that the file was too big to be uploaded 
                to the remote server.
                </li>
                <li>
                I tried to add a clickable image on Future page. I was successful in doing that, the 'google Foobar' image was 
                clickable, it opened the google foobar challenge on a new tab. However, because it was an external link,
                Ed marker raised 10 errors for it. I asked my tutor and he told me, I went "Ahead and Beyond", which is good,
                however, this assignment has its limitation. So, I had to remove the external link. 
                </li>
        </ul>
       </li>

        </ul>
            </div>
            <br>

        <div class="commentsshadow">

        <h1 class="commentsheading" id="tech"> Technical Aspect: CSS Selctors and ID</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <'meta'> tag viewport HTML code has been added in the <'head'> of all webpages which will give the browser instructions 
            on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling to remain uniform in all kinds of screen sizes.
        </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                The minimum requirement for the assignment was to use 5 CSS Classes and 1 CSS ID. Because the navigation menu, bodies, 
                footers and text boxes are all differnent across pages due to themeing, I ended up using a lot more classes and IDs.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                I used 20 CSS Classes and 5 CSS IDs. The following table summarises my usage:

        <br>
        <li>
            The font style and size for page headings, sub-headings and texts are consistent throughout all the pages.
            Page Headings are in "Russo One" font. Sub-Headings are in "Marker Felt, Fantasy" and normal texts in "Times New Roman".
            The font size is also consistent. All webpages have been defined such that the texts are readable across all screen sizes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            All the background colours in webpages have been matched to the colours of the graphics repectively.

        <li>
            Future Webpage:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Star Wars has always been associated with 'Future'. I've used a picture which resembles
                    space vibe of Star Wars to relate it to 'Future'. 
                </li>
            <li>
            Another striking feature of this webpage is, unlike other pages where solid colour
            background is used for navigation menu, space image has been used as backgroud 
            for navigation menu to provide a feeling of "Limitless galaxy".
            </li>

            Past Webpage:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All ideas and images related to 'Past' contained clocks, hourglass or timepieces. 
                    I did not want such a theme. I rather went with minimalistic look using flat 
                    coloured geometric patterns on top of one another.
                </li>
                <li>
                'Past' is the only webpage where image has been used as a background for paragraph text. 
                </li>
                <li>
                RGB colour matching tool has been used to set the colour of the navigation menu same 
                as the colour of the backgroud in this webpage.
                </li>
                 <li>
                The opacity of round-cornered text box in 'Past' webpage has been reduced so that the multi-coloured 
                background is visible.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <li>
            Home Page:
            <ul>
                <li>
                   Our tutor told that the Home page should look attractive, that is why 
                   I've used a background that most people will find appealing and soothing : a serene scenic mountain background.
                
                </li>
                <li>
                     I was unsure of the colours to use as everyone has different perspective. I read that 
                it is psychologically proven that most people find the combination of Black 
                and White to be pleasing, So I used basic White, Black and Grey colours in this webpage.

                        This page contains most of the text, so high contrast white on black is used so that the webpage is 
                        easy to read while maintaining the distinctive gaming look.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Appealing to the fellow gamers, ROG Red on Black with gaming symbols have been used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The navigation menu buttons on this page turn white text on red when hovered over, corresponding to the theme.

                    All images [including the background images] used in the four webpages have 'alt' attribute,

                    with the relative increase and decrease of webpage size. The zoom in and out feature has been tested in
                    Safari and Chrome browsers.

                    <br>
                    All the webpages are responsive and can be accessed on any device regardless of its screen size. The next 
                    picture shows all the webpages on a smartphone.

                <li>High Contrast Text:
                    <br>
                    The text on the webpages highly contrasts with the background colours, which 
                    makes the information easier to read. Page titles, menus and headings are large enough
                    to be read clearly even from distance.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Page up:
                    <br>
                    A direct link at the bottom of each page takes users directly to the top, which
                    may be helpful with smaller devices because pages get long in smaller devices 
                    and users will not have to manually scroll up.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Bookmarks:
                    <br>
                    The imformation contained in this comments page is quite large. Finding specific titles
                    will be a tedious task in smaller devices, so bookmarks to all major headings have been added
                    at the bottom of this page, so that users can easily locate the imformation they need.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Bullet points where necessary:
                    <br>
                    Bullet points, lists and tables have been used extensively throughout all four pages
                    to structure imformation precisely which is easier to follow and read.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Simple to understand: 
                    <br>
                 The website also touches on cognitive disabilities, distractibility and inability to remember or focus on large amounts of information by 
                 keeping the content in all the four webpages clear and succinct, which limits confusion and ambiguity.
                 Navigation is consistent and predictable, all webpages are logically structured in the same pattern and the text is written as clearly and simply as possible.
