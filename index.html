            <p>
                I am an international student from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ pursuing Software Engineering 
                at UTS. I love coding. Being a self-starter and a highly 
                motivated individual, I want to be the creative mind 
                behind computer programs to find solutions to various 
                problems of global society with its efficient use. I 
                am responsible and confident to take 
                initiative in the direst of situations. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I love listening to bass-heavy EDM music as well as sweet songs. I'm good at playing games, both indoor and outdoor.
                I'm very good at badminton. I love
                playing GTA (Grand Theft Auto) games. I've completed GTA III, GTA Vice City, GTA San
                Andreas, GTA Liberty City, GTA Liberty City Stories (PSP version of GTA Liberty City with 
                different story), GTA Vice City Stories (PSP version of GTA Vice City with 
                different story) and GTA IV. Although, Macbooks are famous for not being good at gaming,
                I have played most of the GTA games on my M1 Macbook Air. I also have an PSP emulator called
                PPSSPP on my Mac which enables me to play Play Station games on my Mac.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have not guessed already, I'm a very Tech-Savvy person. I use both an iPhone and a S-series Samsung
                phone because there some things that one does better than the other. I feel I can write an entire 
                book on <ins>"Android Vs iPhone"</ins>. I have all kind of eldritch softwares on my Mac, some of which 
                are rigged. For example, I have a software called "CrossOver" which translates the x86 Architecture of Windows 
                software to run on ARM-based M1 chip of Apple. The software had a trial period of 7 days but I extended the trial
                period to 32 years  ðŸ˜‚ by changing the registration date of the software to a date 32 years later. So, the software
                thinks that it will be opened for the first time after 32 years and the trial period will run for 7 days from then.
                Well, that's enough about me, I can't believe you are still reading !
