        <p> I started coding when I was 12 years old.
            When I discovered that computers only understand 0 and 1, my amusement knew no bounds. 
            I was flabbergasted to see that every alphabet, every string, every number and even 
            the special characters have their own formula in the 0's and 1â€™s. 
            The fact that every piece of technology around us was driven by this stream of binary 
            codes, got me engrossed. And this proved to be the triggering point in my life which motivated 
            me to explore more in computer science. The idea that a few lines of code can create a sensational 
            game has never ceased to mesmerize me. I created a Tic Tac Toe game in Java when I was 16 years old. With each passing day, my passion towards this unlimited 
            world intensified. Programming has been dopamine for my brain ever since then.  </p>
